           <div class="post-content">
               <p>Every <strong><em>strategist</em> </strong>has acquired their own <em>toolkit</em> over the years. Mine blends strong strategic process with design thinking and collaborating with teams. This just happens be very well suited to the rapid growth of online opportunities and challenges faced by many businesses. I draw upon various methods as part of this toolkit (market analysis, experience reviews, desktop research, scenario planning, etc).</p>
               <p>All strategists have , <em>toolkits</em> that fit with their unique approach. No toolkit is the same. Each toolkit is developed overtime.</p>

           <div class="post-content">
               
            <p>History has taught us that there are always paradigms and paradigm shifts and that understanding and positioning
                oneself for them is essential for one’s well-being as an investor and beyond. The purpose of this piece is to show
                you market and economic paradigms and their shifts over the past 100 years to convey how they work. In the
                accompanying piece, “The Coming Paradigm Shift,” I explain my thinking about the one that might be ahead. </p>
